<h1> Lambda Architecture </h1>


<h3> Streaming </h3>
<p> Often we want to deploy our machine learning models to make prediction on live data. Opearting on a stream of data presents some unique challanges including</p>

<ul>
<li> Rebuilding our model to reflect the changing world</li>
<li> Deploy models that can run quickly</li>
<li> Scalability and fault tolerance</li>
</ul>

<p> For instance we build a machine learning model to predict a price. As inflation expecations changes etc, our model needs to take this new information into account. </p>

<p> The most common way we address these problems are using Lambda Architecture. </p>
