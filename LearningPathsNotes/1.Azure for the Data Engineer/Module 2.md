<h1> Survey the services on the Azure Data platform </h1>

<h3> Introduction </h3>
<ul>
<li> Learn about Azure technologies </li>
<li> Explore common Azure data platform technologies and identify when to use them. </li>
<li> Learn how engineers can choose technologies to meet their business needs </li>
</li>
</ul>

<h3> Structured data: Review </h3>
<ul>
<li> Relational databases: Microsoft SQL Server, Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Data Warehouse </li> 
<li> Data structure defined at design time, before data is loaded into the system </li> 
<li> Designed in the form of tables </li> 
<li> Reacts slowly to changes because of that the structural database needs to change every time a data requirement change </li>
<li> When new columns are added, you might need to bulk-update all existing records </li>
<li> Typically uses a query language such as Transact-SQL </li>   
</ul>

<h3> Nonstructured data: Review </h3>
<ul>
<li> Examples of nonstructured data include binary, audio and image files. </li> 
<li> Nonrelational systems, commonly called NoSQL systems. </li> 
<li> Data structure isn't defined at deisgn time, loaded in its raw format</li> 
<li> The data structure is defined only when the data is read </li>
<li> Nonrelatonal systems can also support semistructured data such as JSON file formats</li>
<li>  </li>   
</ul>

<h3> Four types of open-source NoSQL databases </h3>
<ul>
<li> <b> Key-value store: </b> Stores key-value pairs of data in a table structure. </li> 
<li> <b> Document database: </b> Stores documents that are tagged with metadata to aid document searches.</li> 
<li> <b> Graph database: </b> Graph database: Find relationship between data points by using a structure that's composed of vertices and edges.</li> 
<li> <b> Column database: </b> Stores data based on columns rather than rows. Columns can be defined at the query's runtime, allowing flexibility in the data that's returned performantly. </li> 
</ul>
